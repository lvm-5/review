# review
To run project use "gradle clean build runReviewAnalyzing" or 
"gradle clean build runReviewAnalyzingWithTranslate". 
I know there are things that could be implemented better, so if it's actual to you I can 
- improve memory management, 
- improve final part of translating,
- differentiate requests for web service

P.S. I didn't commite Reviews.csv file due to it's a huge. So please place it in the root project directory before the application is run.
