# review
To run project use "gradle clean build runReviewAnalyzing" or 
"gradle clean build runReviewAnalyzingWithTranslate". 
I know there are things that could be implemented better, so if it's actual to you I can 
- improve memory management, 
- improve final part of translating,
- differentiate requests for web service
